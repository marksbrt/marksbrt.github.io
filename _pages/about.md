Hello and thanks for visiting this site! My name is Mark, and I am an astronomer currently working as a Postdoc at Chalmers University. I am originally from the U.S., and I received my PhD from the University of Virginia in 2024. My research interests lie in radio astronomy, the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars, and astrochemistry. You can learn more, and see my publications using the links above!

If you have any questions about myself or my work, please don't hesitate to contact me at [link](mark.siebert@chalmers.se).
